# Crosswords
This program consists of three themed crossword puzzles, each with a minimum of 16 words built across and down with clues. The puzzles can either be timed and untimed. If the level has been successfully solved, the user can choose to view a leaderboard from mainMenu(), which ranks the highest scores for each puzzle depending on word solved and time taken.

*Note:
There is still an error in the program where the timing system encouters bugs when the user leaves a level and then immediately plays another level afterwards.
